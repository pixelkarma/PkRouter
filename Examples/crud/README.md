# PkRouter C.R.U.D. Example

This example explores all the features of PkRouter, but is not intended as production code. PkRouter does not implement any security features that would be required to make a system like this safe in the real world.

_Please be sure `./Examples/crud/data/store.json` is writable_

### This example covers

* Extending PkRoutesConfig (MyRoutes.php)
* Creating Middleware (./src/Middleware/)
* Passing data between Middleware
* Using Dynamic Properties
* Extending PkRequest to accept XML (CustomRequest.php)
* Extending PkResponse to send XML (CustomResponse.php)
* Custom Log function (./public/index.php)
* Using route specific 'meta' data 
* Sending custom response headers
* Listening for custom request headers

## How to run this example

```bash
# From ./Examples/crud
composer install
cd public
php -S localhost:8080
```
